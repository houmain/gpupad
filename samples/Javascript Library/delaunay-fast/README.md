This is just a quick little implementation of [Delaunay Triangulation][1] in
JavaScript. It was mostly ported from [Paul Bourke's C implementation][2], but
I referenced some bits from [another JavaScript implementation][3] and rewrote
a bunch of things in ways more amenable to fast JavaScript execution.

Essentially, you pass Delaunay.triangulate a list of vertices (which should be
a bunch of two-element arrays, representing 2D Euclidean points), and it will
return you a giant array, arranged in triplets, representing triangles by
indices into the passed array. (This representation is a little bizarre, but
object allocation is too slow for this library's [original use case][4]. Yes,
really.)

Beware of using vertices that are too close to each other (say, within 0.01 on
either axis): numerical precision issues may result, causing your mesh to be
invalid. (If you encounter this, simply multiply each of your vertices'
positions by a constant factor.)
